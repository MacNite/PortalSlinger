# PortalSlinger
PortalSlinger is an OpenSource Large Format 3D printer. The Idea was to built a large format 3D printer in the most affordable way without sacrificing to much performance. I've tested successfully teste print speeds of up to 100mm/s.

There is an untested / unbuilt beta-Version-CAD-Model available - this is only for "what is to come", major changes include re-positioning of y-belts, different tool head (not yet desgined) and MGN9H rails for the z-axis. Proceed with caution! https://a360.co/2XAqKi2
